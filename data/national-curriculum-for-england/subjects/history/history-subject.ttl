  dcterms:description """A high-quality history education will help pupils gain a coherent 
  knowledge and understanding of Britain’s past and that of the wider world. It should inspire 
  pupils’ curiosity to know more about the past. Teaching should equip pupils to ask perceptive 
  questions, think critically, weigh evidence, sift arguments, and develop perspective and 
  judgement. History helps pupils to understand the complexity of people’s lives, the process of 
  change, the diversity of societies and relationships between different groups, as well as their 
  own identity and the challenges of their time."""@en ;
