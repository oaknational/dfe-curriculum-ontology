<p>XXXXX The DfE Curriculum Ontology provides a standardized, machine-readable representation of educational curriculum structures. It defines core classes and properties for representing phases, key stages, subjects, and content organization within the National Curriculum for England. This ontology enables interoperability across educational platforms, semantic querying of curriculum relationships, and validation of curriculum data quality through SHACL constraints.</p>
