This ontology defines the foundational classes and properties for representing educational curriculum structures. It organizes curriculum data into three main hierarchies:

 1. **Temporal Hierarchy**: Phases, key stages, and year groups (age-based progression)
 2. **Programme Hierarchy**: Subjects, sub-subjects, and schemes (how subjects are organized)
 3. **Knowledge Taxonomy**: Disciplines, strands, and content descriptors (how knowledge is structured)

 The ontology is designed to be reusable across different UK curricula while currently focusing on the National Curriculum for England. It enables interoperability across educational platforms,
 semantic querying of curriculum relationships, and validation of curriculum data quality through SHACL constraints.
